To use this quiz, first click the Begin button, then select from the answers presented on the screen based on the question given. If an answer selected is incorrect, 100 seconds will be deducted from the timer. Once the timer reaches zero or all questions have been answered, the quiz will end and the user will be presented with an opportunity to record their score on the high scores list and try again.
